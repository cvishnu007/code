# My Coding Dojo ðŸ¥‹

Welcome to my personal coding dojo! This repository is my digital space for practice, experimentation, and learning. It's where I sharpen my skills and tackle new challenges to build my programming muscle memory.

## About This Repository

This repo serves as a living journal of my journey in mastering various programming languages, frameworks, and concepts. It's less about polished, final projects and more about the raw process of learning and practicing.

Anything I'm learning or practicing will be added here to make sure the knowledge doesn't just stay in my head, but gets **"in my gut."**

## What You'll Find Here

You can expect to find a mix of:
* **Code Snippets:** Quick solutions and explorations of specific features.
* **Small Projects:** Mini-applications to practice core concepts.
* **Algorithm Practice:** Solutions to challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
* **Tutorial Follow-Alongs:** Code from tutorials and courses I'm taking.

This space is always evolving, just like my skills. Thanks for stopping by!
